# Lavalink.js

<p>
    Lavalink.js is a JavaScript wrapper wich you can use with your Discord.js bot. It uses the Lavalink technology to broadcast music, so you need Java SE 11 installed in your machine.
</p>
<p>
    First of all, I would to thank Matthieu#2050, a friend and a hobbyist developer wich helped me for implementing the websocket and for fixing some bugs. To thanks them, you can visit his website: <a href="https://matthieu-dev.xyz/" target="_blank">Matthieu Dev</a> :D

<p>
    Let's take care about the Java part currently!</br>
    The Java JRE 11 or higher shoud be installed on your machine. If you have an old version of the Java JRE od JDK please <strong>uninstall</strong> it and <strong>reboot</strong> your machine. Then open your internet browser and paste this URL to the address bar: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html" target="_blank">Java SE downloads</a>.

Then download the adapted setup for your machine, and install it by following indicated instructions, or by reading docs for Linux/Unix systems.
</p>

> <p>Note that is you're using Windows operating system you have to add the Java JDK to path to use it directly from any terminal. For it please read this: <a href="https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10" target="_blank">How to set JAVA_HOME in Windows 10</a>.</p>

## Lavalink server installation:

<p>
    Create on your project root directory a folder named 'lavalink'. Next download the <a href="https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases/download/3.3/Lavalink.jar" target="_blank"> Lavalink server</a> into it. Then you have to create a file in your code editor, always in the same directory, and named 'application.yml'. This file allow the Lavalink server configuration, by providing broadcasting settings and by providing server host, port and password.
