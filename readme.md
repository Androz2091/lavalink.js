# Lavalink.js

<p>

</p>
<p>
    First of all, I would to thank Matthieu#2050, a friend and a hobbyist developer wich helped me for implementing the websocket and for fixing some bugs. To thanks them, you can visit his website: <a href="https://matthieu-dev.xyz/" target="_blank">Matthieu Dev</a> :D

<p>
    Let's take care about the Java part currently!</br>

> <p>Note that is you're using Windows operating system you have to add the Java JDK to path to use it directly from any terminal. For it please read this: <a href="https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10" target="_blank">How to set JAVA_HOME in Windows 10</a>.</p>

## Lavalink server installation:

    Create on your project root directory a folder named 'lavalink'. Next download the <a href="https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases/download/3.3/Lavalink.jar" target="_blank"> Lavalink server</a> into it. Then you have to create a file in your code editor, always in the same directory, and named 'application.yml'. This file allow the Lavalink server configuration, by providing broadcasting settings and by providing server host, port and password.
